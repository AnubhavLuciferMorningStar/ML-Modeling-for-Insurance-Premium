# ML Modeling
## Data description
The dataset comprises the following 11 attributes:
  1. Age: Numeric, ranging from 18 to 66 years.
  2. Diabetes: Binary (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the presence of diabetes.
  3. BloodPressureProblems: Binary (0 or 1), indicating the presence of blood pressure-related issues.
  4. AnyTransplants: Binary (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the person has had a transplant.
  5. AnyChronicDiseases: Binary (0 or 1), indicating the presence of any chronic diseases.
  6. Height: Numeric, measured in centimeters, ranging from 145 cm to 188 cm.
  7. Weight: Numeric, measured in kilograms, ranging from 51 kg to 132 kg.
  8. KnownAllergies: Binary (0 or 1), where 1 indicates known allergies.
  9. HistoryOfCancerInFamily: Binary (0 or 1), indicating a family history of cancer.
  10. NumberOfMajorSurgeries: Numeric, counting the number of major surgeries, ranging from 0 to 3 surgeries.
  11. PremiumPrice: Numeric, representing the premium price in currency, ranging from 15,000 to 40,000.

## Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
  * Handling Missing Values: Although initial data checks may not show missing values, always prepare to implement strategies for handling them.
  * Feature Engineering: Create new features that might improve model performance, such as Body Mass Index (BMI) from height and weight.
  * Scaling and Encoding: Apply appropriate scaling to numerical features and encoding to categorical features to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

2. Model Selection:
  * Linear Regression: Start with a simple model to establish a baseline for prediction accuracy.
  * Tree-based Models: Implement models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines for their ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature importance analysis.
  * Neural Networks: Explore more complex models like neural networks if the initial models show promising results but require more flexibility in capturing interactions.

3. Model Evaluation and Validation:
  * Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model performs well across different subsets of the dataset.
  * Performance Metrics: Depending on the business objective, use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), or RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination) to evaluate model performance.
  * Confidence Intervals/Prediction Intervals: Provide these intervals along with predictions to give users an idea of prediction reliability.

4. Interpretability and Explainability:
  * Feature Importance: Use techniques like permutation importance in tree-based models or SHAP values to explain the influence of each feature on the prediction.
  * Model Insights: Translate the model's findings into actionable business insights, such as identifying risk factors that significantly increase insurance costs, which can be used for targeted interventions.
